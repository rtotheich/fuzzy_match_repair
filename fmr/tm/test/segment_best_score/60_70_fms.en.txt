The Commission concluded in recital (332) that the repeal of the measures would in all likelihood result in a significant increase of dumped imports from the countries concerned at prices undercutting the Union industry prices, and therefore further aggravate the injury suffered by the Union industry and thus demonstrated the likelihood of recurrence of injury originally caused by dumped imports from the countries concerned, including Russia, if the measures were repealed.	60
