The assessment on the proportionality of the measures requested must take into account the general duties in relation to privacy set out in Section 2 (2) of the IPA 2016, notably the need to assess whether what is sought to be achieved by the warrant, authorisation or notice could reasonably be achieved by other less intrusive means and whether the level of protection to be applied in relation to any obtaining of information by virtue of the warrant, is higher because of the particular sensitivity of that information (see recital (181) above).	These general duties in relation to privacy are now set out in Section 2 (2) of the IPA 2016, which provides that a public authority acting under the IPA 2016 must have regard to whether what is sought to be achieved by the warrant, authorisation or notice could reasonably be achieved by other less intrusive means, whether the level of protection to be applied in relation to any obtaining of information by virtue of the warrant, authorisation or notice is higher because of the particular sensitivity of that information, the public interest in the integrity and security of telecommunication systems and postal services, and any other aspects of the public interest in the protection of privacy.	71	The,assessment,on,the,proportionality,of,the,measures,requested,must,take,into,account,the,notably,need,assess,and,see,recital,181,above	1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,31,33,35,58,89,90,91,92
