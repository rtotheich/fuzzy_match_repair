In this regards, the Commission further notes that, on all of the route bundles currently operated under the new Convention by SNS, the to some extent comparable services provided by the other operators were also subsidised and were in any event not fully equivalent in terms of continuity, regularity, capacity and quality and therefore did not satisfy in full the public service needs identified by Italy in the new Convention.

The Commission concluded in recital (332) that the repeal of the measures would in all likelihood result in a significant increase of dumped imports from the countries concerned at prices undercutting the Union industry prices, and therefore further aggravate the injury suffered by the Union industry and thus demonstrated the likelihood of recurrence of injury originally caused by dumped imports from the countries concerned, including Russia, if the measures were repealed.	The Commission noted that Article 3 (4) of the basic Regulation relates to the assessment of the effects of actual imports on the Union industry to determine injury in the framework of an anti-dumping investigation, while the simulation carried out by the Commission in recitals (327) to (329) relates to the determination of the likelihood of recurrence of injury originally caused by imports from the countries concerned in case the measures are allowed to lapse.	60	concluded,in,recital,332,the,repeal,measures,would,in,all,likelihood,result,in,a,significant,increase,of,dumped,imports,from,countries,concerned,at,prices,undercutting,prices,and,therefore,further,aggravate,the,suffered,Union,industry,and,thus,demonstrated,dumped,including,Russia,if,were,repealed	2,3,4,5,7,8,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,26,27,28,29,30,34,35,36,37,38,39,41,44,45,46,47,48,58,64,65,66,69,70

The Commission noted that Article 3 (4) of the basic Regulation relates to the assessment of the effects of actual imports on the Union industry to determine injury in the framework of an anti-dumping investigation, while the simulation carried out by the Commission in recitals (327) to (329) relates to the determination of the likelihood of recurrence of injury originally caused by imports from the countries concerned in case the measures are allowed to lapse.	The Commission concluded in recital (332) that the repeal of the measures would in all likelihood result in a significant increase of dumped imports from the countries concerned at prices undercutting the Union industry prices, and therefore further aggravate the injury suffered by the Union industry and thus demonstrated the likelihood of recurrence of injury originally caused by dumped imports from the countries concerned, including Russia, if the measures were repealed.	60	noted,Article,3,4,basic,Regulation,relates,to,the,assessment,the,effects,of,actual,on,to,determine,injury,in,framework,of,an,anti-dumping,investigation,while,the,simulation,carried,out,Commission,in,recitals,327,to,329,relates,to,the,determination,of,in,case,are,allowed,to,lapse	2,4,5,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17,18,19,21,25,26,27,28,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,67,68,71,72,73,74
